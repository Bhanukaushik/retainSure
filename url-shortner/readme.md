Implementation Notes
This project implements a simple URL shortening service using Flask and Python, following all the functional requirements specified in the task. The core features include URL shortening, redirection, and analytics, all handled using in-memory storage as per the constraints.

I structured the project with clarity in mind:

All route logic is inside main.py using Flask’s app factory pattern.

URL mappings are stored in a centralized storage.py module.

Short code generation and validation are handled in a separate utils.py.

Tests are located in the tests/ folder and written using pytest.

The shortening endpoint (POST /api/shorten) accepts a valid long URL and returns a 6-character alphanumeric short code. That mapping is stored in memory with metadata like creation time and click count. The redirect endpoint (GET /<short_code>) handles redirection and increments the counter. Finally, the stats endpoint (GET /api/stats/<short_code>) returns all associated metadata for the short code.

I intentionally avoided any external database or custom short code logic to stay within the assignment boundaries. Error handling was added across all endpoints, and proper status codes are returned in every response. For URL validation, I used the validators library, which provided a quick and reliable way to filter out malformed input.

I tested all critical functionality using pytest. The tests cover:

Health check

Successful URL shortening

Invalid input handling

Redirection behavior

Analytics reporting

404s for unknown short codes

I used AI tools at two key points during this implementation:

First, to convert equivalent API logic from an earlier Node.js version I had written into Flask — mainly to save time on setup and edge case handling.

Second, to cross-check the structure and syntax of my pytest test cases, especially for things like handling redirects and verifying headers.

All generated code was reviewed line by line and manually adjusted. I made sure to prioritize readability, correctness, and adherence to REST conventions throughout the project.

With more time, I would:

Add persistence (e.g., file or SQLite storage) so short codes survive restarts

Add logging for usage insights and debugging

Package the app using Docker for portability

Overall, this was a clean and enjoyable build with a strong focus on correctness and simplicity.
